# fcc_test_html
html page from freecodecamp Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=916GWv2Qs08

This is an initial way for me to learn HTML and how to deploy html to my own personal webpage. This will be uploaded to test.litzhiong.com.

If the page is not present anymore, it means that I didn't bother to renew my domain really, nothing more.
